/*

num % 2     => can tell us if num is even or odd
num % 10    => gives the last digit of num
num / 10    => removes the last digit from num (integer division)
r = n % k    => r must be < k

divide '/' operator always takes the bigger data type:
int/int = int
int/float OR float/int = float
int/double OR double/int = double
